my third project for the athena awards! (and definitely not the last) i wanted to combine my two interests, computer science and music, and i found this ysws for the athena awards and was like: why not? so here we are!

WHY i made this website: i wanted to combine my two interests, computer science and music, and this tutorial does exactly that! it was so fun to see how the two fields interact with each other!

HOW i made this website: for the first time, i created a website mainly using javascript! which was something i haven't previously done before so it was very interesting to see the change and how it manifested in my final project

something i struggled with: definitely using javascript and trying to understand how all the apis and methods and functions came together to be able to perform a task such as recording on a computer. definitely struggled with the setup of my recording api code, which took so long, but i'm finally done! its not perfect ui wise, but i'll edit later for aesthetics and all that. the main thing is that it's functional! loll
